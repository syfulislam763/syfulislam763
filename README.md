## 👨‍💻 React Native Developer ( android | ios ) & AI and Research Enthusiast

## 🧾 About Me

I'm a versatile and forward-thinking developer with over a year of hands-on experience in crafting high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications using React Native. I specialize in building elegant, scalable user interfaces and managing complex navigation flows with React Navigation and Context API. Whether deploying with Expo or going bare-metal, I bring both technical depth and design precision to every project.

Beyond mobile, I have a strong foundation in full-stack development with the MERN stack, backend engineering with FastAPI and MySQL, and machine learning with TensorFlow and scikit-learn. I’ve published peer-reviewed research on multimodal gesture recognition systems, reflecting my passion for building AI-powered, human-centric technology.

My background also includes a deep commitment to problem solving — honed through solving 700+ challenges on competitive programming platforms and qualifying twice for the ICPC Dhaka Regional Contest. I bring that same focus and curiosity into every system I design, debug, and deploy.

At my core, I’m not just a mobile developer — I’m a builder, a thinker, and a relentless learner who thrives at the intersection of code, creativity, and impact.
